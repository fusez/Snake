### TLDR? How to get started can be found at the bottom of the post.

## Brief Presentation
With this piece of code you can play snake both solo and against 1-3 other players.

To get started simply use the command /snake ingame.

From there you will be able to navigate yourself into a game in no time with ease with the minimalistic and stylish looking textdraw menus.

Your results will be saved into a local database file that you can browse ingame, and sort by playername in alphabetical order / size / kills / date & time in ascending and descending order.

See it for yourself! Check the video and image album below.
